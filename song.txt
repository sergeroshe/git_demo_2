Ozzy & Drix, O-O-Ozzy & Drix!
Trouble in the air, what'cha gonna do?
(It's a cold, it's a fever, or maybe the flu
Ah-ah-choooooo!)

Meet Ozzy & Drix, private eye
Cuttin' germs and viruses down to size
Busy defending all the nerve endings
They got guts and nerves vim and verne

(They're bad to the bone, even badder in the bladder,
make a scene in the spleen, put the hustle in the muscle,
put the hip in the hips, the word on the lips,
ideas in the brain, keepin' him sane!)
Keepin' him sane!

Lookin' good, like a blood cell should
(Like a blood cell should!)
Ozzy & Drix, O-O-Ozzy & Drix!

Inside the body and mind
From the tip of the nose to the behind
They're the protectors of the City of Hector
Ozzy & Drix!
